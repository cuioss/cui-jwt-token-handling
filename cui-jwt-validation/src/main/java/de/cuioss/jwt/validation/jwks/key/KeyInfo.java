/**
 * Record that holds information about a key, including the key itself and its algorithm.
 * <p>
 * This record is used to store keys along with their algorithm information to support
 * cryptographic agility. The record provides immutability guarantees and value-based
 * equality by default, making it ideal for representing key information.
 * <p>
 * For more details on the security aspects, see the

 *
 * @param key The public key used for JWT signature verification. This is the cryptographic
 *            key extracted from the JWK that will be used to verify the signature of JWT tokens.
 *            It's typically an RSA or EC public key.
 * @param algorithm The algorithm identifier associated with this key. This field contains
 *                  the algorithm name (e.g., "RS256", "ES384") that should be used with this
 *                  key for signature verification. The algorithm must match the "alg" header
 *                  in the JWT Token for successful verification. Common values include:
 *                  RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512.
 * @param keyId The unique identifier for this key. This is the "kid" (Key ID) value from
 *              the JWK, which is used to identify the specific key within a JWKS. When
 *              verifying a JWT Token, the "kid" in the validation header is matched against
 *              this value to select the correct key for signature verification. Key IDs are
 *              particularly important in environments with key rotation, where multiple
 *              valid keys may exist simultaneously.

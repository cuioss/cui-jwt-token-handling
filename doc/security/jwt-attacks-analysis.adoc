== Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of common JWT vulnerabilities and attacks as documented in the article "The Ultimate Guide to JWT Vulnerabilities and Attacks" from PentesterLab (https://pentesterlab.com/blog/jwt-vulnerabilities-attacks-guide). Each vulnerability is analyzed, the current mitigation approach in our library is documented, and test coverage is assessed.

For detailed implementation information on how these mitigations are implemented, see the link:security-specifications.adoc#jwt-attack-mitigations[JWT Attack Mitigations] section in the Security Specifications document.

For guidance on secure token handling practices for application developers, see the link:jwt-security-best-practices.adoc[JWT Security Best Practices Guide].

== Vulnerability Analysis

=== 1. Signature Not Verified

==== Description
One of the most common and dangerous implementation mistakes when using JWTs is failing to verify the signature. If an application skips this step (often using a library's `decode()` method instead of `verify()`), attackers can forge arbitrary claims.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library's design enforces signature verification:

* All token processing starts with the `TokenValidator` class which enforces the validation pipeline
* The `TokenSignatureValidator` class is a mandatory component of this pipeline
* Direct token decoding without verification is not exposed in the public API
* The `NonValidatingJwtParser` is only used internally as part of the validation pipeline

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidator.java[TokenValidator.java:264-333] - Enforces ordered validation pipeline with mandatory signature validation
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java:80-148] - Validates signatures using secure cryptographic operations with standard JDK providers
* No public API methods expose token decoding without signature verification

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorTest] - Comprehensive tests for the signature validation process:
** `shouldValidateTokenWithValidSignature()` - Verifies that valid signatures are accepted
** `shouldRejectTokenWithInvalidSignature()` - Verifies that invalid signatures are rejected
** `shouldRejectTokenWithAlgorithmConfusionAttack()` - Verifies protection against algorithm confusion

=== 2. None Algorithm Attack

==== Description
The JWT specification allows tokens to specify the signing algorithm in their header using the `alg` field. If libraries accept `none` as a valid option, attackers can forge tokens without needing a signature.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library explicitly rejects the "none" algorithm. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#none-algorithm-attack[None Algorithm Attack] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SignatureAlgorithmPreferences.java[SignatureAlgorithmPreferences.java:53] - "none" algorithm is explicitly listed in REJECTED_ALGORITHMS
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java:229-241] - Signature validator rejects tokens with unsupported algorithms
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator.java:110-132] - Header validator checks algorithm support before signature validation

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidatorAlgorithmTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorAlgorithmTest] - Tests algorithm validation

=== 3. Trivial Secret (Weak HMAC Keys)

==== Description
When using HMAC-based algorithms like `HS256`, the integrity of the JWT depends entirely on the secrecy and strength of the shared secret key. If the key is weak, guessable, or hardcoded, an attacker can brute-force it.

==== Impact

* Token forgery
* Authentication bypass

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library provides protection against weak keys. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#trivial-secret-weak-hmac-keys[Trivial Secret] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SignatureAlgorithmPreferences.java[SignatureAlgorithmPreferences.java:53] - HMAC algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512) are explicitly rejected to prevent weak secret vulnerabilities
* Library exclusively supports asymmetric algorithms (RS*, ES*, PS*) eliminating shared secret vulnerabilities
* No support for HMAC-based algorithms removes the risk of weak key attacks entirely

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SignatureAlgorithmPreferencesTest.java[SignatureAlgorithmPreferencesTest] - Tests algorithm preferences
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/KeyDisclosureVulnerabilityTest.java[KeyDisclosureVulnerabilityTest] - Tests protection against key disclosure

=== 4. Algorithm Confusion (RSA to HMAC)

==== Description
This attack exploits the fact that the JWT header includes a user-controlled `alg` parameter. If the server doesn't enforce which algorithm is expected, an attacker can manipulate the header to cause the backend to verify the token using the wrong algorithm — often with catastrophic consequences.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library implements several protections against algorithm confusion attacks. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#algorithm-confusion[Algorithm Confusion] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SignatureAlgorithmPreferences.java[SignatureAlgorithmPreferences.java:53] - HMAC algorithms are explicitly rejected, preventing RSA-to-HMAC confusion attacks
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java:250-262] - Algorithm compatibility validation ensures token algorithm matches key type
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java:140-148] - Strict algorithm-key matching prevents confusion attacks

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorTest] - Tests algorithm confusion protection through `shouldRejectAlgorithmConfusionAttack()`

=== 5. `kid` Injection (Key ID Manipulation)

==== Description
The JWT header supports a field called `kid` (Key ID) that allows the token to indicate which key should be used to verify the signature. If applications dynamically fetch keys based on this field — especially from filesystems or databases — the `kid` value becomes a dangerous injection point.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass
* Remote command execution
* SQL Injection

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library implements several protections against Key ID injection attacks. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#kid-injection[Key ID Injection] in the Security Specifications document.

* The `kid` value is validated and sanitized
* Direct file or database lookups based on the `kid` value are not supported
* Key management is abstracted through the `JwksLoader` interface
* Keys are pre-loaded and cached, limiting the impact of manipulated `kid` values

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java:96-105] - Mandatory Key ID validation rejects tokens without valid kid
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java:129-138] - Key retrieval through secure JwksLoader abstraction prevents direct file/DB access
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/http/HttpJwksLoader.java[HttpJwksLoader.java:116-128] - Keys are pre-loaded and cached via HTTPS, eliminating dynamic key fetching based on kid values

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorTest] - Tests rejection of tokens with invalid `kid` values in `shouldRejectTokenWhenKeyNotFound()`
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/KeyInjectionAttackTest.java[KeyInjectionAttackTest] - Comprehensive tests for KID injection attacks:
** Tests path traversal via `kid` header
** Tests SQL injection via `kid` header
** Tests null byte injection via `kid` header
** Tests command injection via `kid` header
** Tests very long `kid` header (potential DoS attack)

=== 6. Embedded JWK (CVE-2018-0114)

==== Description
JWTs can optionally include a JWK (JSON Web Key) directly inside the token header using the `jwk` parameter. If the server accepts any public key supplied in the token without proper validation, an attacker can embed their own public key into the header and generate tokens that validate against it.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library mitigates this vulnerability by refusing to accept keys from tokens. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#embedded-jwk[Embedded JWK] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator.java:93-102] - Embedded JWK detection explicitly rejects tokens containing "jwk" in header
* All keys must be obtained through secure JwksLoader implementations, never from token headers
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SecurityEventCounter.java[SecurityEventCounter.java] - Tracks UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM events when embedded JWK tokens are detected

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/EmbeddedJwkAttackTest.java[EmbeddedJwkAttackTest] - Tests rejection of tokens with embedded JWK in the header

=== 7. JKU / X5U Header Abuse

==== Description
JWT supports additional headers like `jku` (JWK Set URL) and `x5u` (X.509 certificate URL) that point to external URLs where public keys can be retrieved. If the application does not strictly control the source of these URLs, it opens the door for Server-Side Request Forgery and using attacker-controlled keys.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass
* Server-Side Request Forgery

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library prevents JKU/X5U header abuse by not following arbitrary URLs in tokens. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#jku-x5u-header-abuse[JKU/X5U Header Abuse] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**
* The library does not process `jku` or `x5u` headers from tokens - these headers are ignored
* All JWKS URLs must be explicitly configured in link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/IssuerConfig.java[IssuerConfig.java] during application setup
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/http/HttpJwksLoader.java[HttpJwksLoader.java] - Only fetches keys from pre-configured, trusted JWKS endpoints with TLS enforcement
* No dynamic URL following eliminates SSRF attack vectors

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/JkuX5uAttackTest.java[JkuX5uAttackTest] - Tests rejection of tokens with JKU or X5U headers pointing to malicious URLs

=== 8. CVE-2022-21449 (Psychic Signature)

==== Description
In 2022, a critical vulnerability was discovered in the Java JDK's ECDSA signature verification implementation. This bug allowed attackers to bypass digital signature verification entirely by submitting an invalid signature where both values (`s` and `r`) are set to zero.

==== Impact

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass

==== Current Implementation Status: MITIGATED
The library is protected against the "Psychic Signature" vulnerability. For implementation details, see link:security-specifications.adoc#psychic-signature[Psychic Signature] in the Security Specifications document.

**Implementation Details:**
* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/pipeline/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator.java] - Uses Java 21 standard JDK cryptographic providers which include fixes for CVE-2022-21449
* Java 21 properly validates ECDSA signature components and rejects all-zero signatures
* The library enforces use of standard JDK providers with Java 21, which includes comprehensive security fixes

==== Test Coverage

* link:../../cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/PsychicSignatureAttackTest.java[PsychicSignatureAttackTest] - Tests rejection of tokens with all-zero ECDSA signatures (ES256, ES384, ES512)

== Summary and Recommendations

The library currently implements mitigations for all major JWT vulnerabilities. However, the following recommendations are made to further improve security:

1. ✓ Add specific tests for embedded JWK protection
2. ✓ Add specific tests for JKU/X5U header abuse protection
3. ✓ Add specific tests for CVE-2022-21449 protection
4. ✓ Add specific tests for KID injection protection
5. Enhance documentation to highlight security features

These recommendations have been captured in the TODO.adoc document.

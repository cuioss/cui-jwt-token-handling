== Overview

This document provides a reference for all log messages used in the JWT Token Validation library.

=== Document Navigation

* xref:../README.adoc[README] - Project overview and introduction
* xref:../cui-jwt-validation/README.adoc[Usage Guide] - How to use the library with code examples
* xref:Requirements.adoc[Requirements] - Functional and non-functional requirements
* xref:Specification.adoc[Specification] - Technical specifications
* xref:security/Threat-Model.adoc[Threat Model] - Security analysis and mitigations
* xref:Build.adoc[Building and Development] - Information for contributors

=== Log Message Format

All messages follow the format: JWTValidation-[identifier]: [message]

The log message levels follow these identifier ranges:

* INFO Level: 1-99
* WARN Level: 100-199
* ERROR Level: 200-299

Note: Only log level INFO and above are documented in this file.

=== Using Log Messages for Troubleshooting

The log messages can be used for troubleshooting issues with the JWT Token Validation library. Each log message is associated with a specific component and provides information about what is happening in the system.

For more details about security events related to these log messages, see the SecurityEventCounter implementation in xref:specification/technical-components.adoc#_securityeventcounter[Technical Components].
